### Links

- Solution URL: [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/mobile-first-solution-NvAREKe-rS)
- Live Site URL: [Simple Recipe Page](https://niisari.github.io/recipe-page-main/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned how to write a proper HTML5 semantic structure and how to use classes to properly target each individual element on the page. I've also learned how to properly style elements on the page and how to use flexbox to write a good mobile/desktop compatible layout.

### Continued development

I want to include javascript functionality in future to make the website be more responsive + include a slider that would show more recipes (replace the current recipe page with a new one).

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I used this site a lot for better understanding when i had issues with margin/padding and positioning lists.
